This is a Jekyll project with Zurb Foundation 6 based off of [this starter project]( https://github.com/core77/jekyll-foundation).

It provides a [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) workflow with

- Browsersync (live reload and synchronised browser testing)
- Concatenation and minification of CSS and JavaScript files
- Asset management is done by Bower (and Composer if you need serverside libraries)  
- Deployment with rsync

# Required
Git  
Ruby and Ruby Gems  
Jekyll - gem install jekyll  
Bundler - gem install bundler (mac users may need sudo)  

NodeJS - use the installer  
GulpJS - npm install -g gulp (mac users may need sudo)  
Bower - npm install -g bower  

### Optional
Composer (installs PHPMailer)  
Make (used with rsync for deploying)

# Local Installation

Git clone this repository, or download it into a directory of your choice. Inside the directory run

1. `bower install` (reference: .bowerrc and bower.json)
2. `npm install` (reference: package.json)
3. `bundle install` (reference: Gemfile and Gemfile.lock)
4. `composer install` (optional, reference: composer.json and composer.lock)  

# Get Up and Running

### Build and Serve

- Run `npm start`  
  - This will build your Jekyll site, give you file watching, browser synchronization, auto-rebuild, CSS injecting, Sass sourcemaps etc.
  - The site will be built into the `_dest` folder.
- Go to: http://127.0.0.1.xip.io:3000
  - Here you can access your site. If you want to access it with your phone or tablet, use the external access address which is showing up in the terminal window.
- Go to: http://127.0.0.1.xip.io:3001
  - Here you can access the Browsersync UI.  

### Build for Production

- Run `npm run build`  
  - This builds your site for production, with minified CSS and JavaScript. Run this before you deploy your site!  

You can also run `make build` to do this.

### Foundation for Sites Components

We don't want to include unused CSS or JavaScript.

```
Uncomment the components you want to use
1. Sass in _src/assets/scss/foundation/_foundation.scss  
2. JavaScript in /gulp/config.yml in javascript.src (you need to restart gulp)
```

Customize the variables used by Foundation in the settings file located in `_src/assets/scss/foundation/`.
Copy the default settings from the foundation-sites package (`_src/assets/vendor/foundation-sites/scss/settings/_settings.scss`) and then change them to your needs  

Place your custom sass in the subfolders of `_src/assets/scss/`. These folders follow the SMACSS architecture. This should be the most scalable solution - from small to very large sites.

### Deploy your site

For includeos.org we use Google Cloud Storage currently. Long term goal is to serve the web pages from IncludeOS itself, but we need some more tooling before we can do that.

Use gs-util to deploy site on Google Cloud Storage. Use the bucket www.includeos.org. Talk to Martin or Per if you need write access to this bucket.

Install gs-util from here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/

The do a produciton build of the site. Sometimes the build might result in some oddities happening on the site so removing "\_dest" before building might make sense.

One gsutil is in place you have the following make targets available:
 * deploy, delete the folder, build the website and sync the whole thing over
 * partial, sync over the website, ignore the assets. This is a lot faster when only updating the textual content
 * rebuild, delete and rebuild the local content
 * build, just build it
 * install, install all the crap needed to build the site locally.

```
rm -r _dest && npm run build
```

Now upload the to Google Cloud Storage:
```
gsutil -m rsync -r \_dest/ gs://www.includeos.org/
```
-m is to make it run in paralell so it uploads faster.

The long term goal is to make the deployment happen through make. At some point we should say:
```
make deploy   # this currently doesn't work.
```
